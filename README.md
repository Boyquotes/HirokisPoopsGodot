Hiroki's Poops is a game where you fly around the sky and shoot poops.
The game started out as a heavy modification of this [pygame tutorial](https://realpython.com/pygame-a-primer/), but after a few years I ported it over to Godot Engine.
I suggest that you check out the original game and see how much it's been changed!
